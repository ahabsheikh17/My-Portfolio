          <br />
          A frontend developer is a professional who specializes in creating the
          user interface and user experience of a website or web application.
          They work with technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build
          visually appealing and interactive elements that users interact with
          directly. Frontend developers collaborate with designers and backend
          developers to ensure a seamless and functional integration of the user
          interface with the underlying system. They are responsible for the
          look, feel, and interactivity of websites, striving to create engaging
          and responsive user experiences.

          Digital marketing is the use of digital channels, such as search
          engines, social media, email, and websites, to promote products or
          services. It encompasses various strategies, including search engine
          optimization (SEO), social media marketing, content marketing, email
          marketing, and online advertising. The goal is to reach and engage a
          target audience, drive brand awareness, and ultimately achieve
          business objectives in the digital space. Data analytics is often
          employed to measure and optimize the effectiveness of digital
          marketing campaigns.
